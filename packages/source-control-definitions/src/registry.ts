/**
 * The server and every client read hosts through this one registry, so they agree on which host
 * owns a URL or remote. GitHub comes first because a repository that has not reported its host
 * yet reads as GitHub, which is what clients have always shown there. A change request URL goes
 * to the first host whose shape it has, so GitCafe, which claims `/pull/` and `/pulls/` only on
 * its own hostnames, claims before GitHub and Forgejo, which claim them everywhere. A hostname can
 * carry more than one host's label (`gitea.github.example`), so remote recognition has its own
 * order.
