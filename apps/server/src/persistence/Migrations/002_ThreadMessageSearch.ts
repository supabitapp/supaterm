/**
 * Full-text index for thread message search. The trigram tokenizer matches any
 * substring of three or more characters, ignoring case and accents, so
 * identifiers inside code still match, without the full-table scan a
 * `LIKE '%q%'` needs.
 *
 * It holds what the user wrote and what agents answered. User-role messages
 * that agents or the system wrote (pull request updates, task notices) would
 * flood results and read as "You".
 *
 * The index is contentless and keyed by the message rowid: search reads the
 * text back from the message row, so the text is not stored twice. `supaterm doctor`
 * rebuilds it after its VACUUM, since SQLite does not promise to keep rowids.
 * Thread search scans the same messages when the index is missing.
 *
 * Triggers keep it in sync with every write to the messages table. Streaming
 * messages are indexed once they finish, with apostrophes folded as search
 * folds them.
