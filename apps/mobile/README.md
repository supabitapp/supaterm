# Supaterm Mobile

> [!WARNING]
> Supaterm Mobile is currently in development and is not distributed yet. If you want to try it out, you can build it from source.

## Quickstart

> [!NOTE]
> Uses native modules so using Expo Go is not supported. You need to use the Expo Dev Client.

This app has three variants:

- `development`: Expo dev client, installable side-by-side as `Supaterm Dev`
- `preview`: persistent internal preview build, installable side-by-side as `Supaterm Preview`
- `production`: store/release build as `Supaterm`

Run commands from `apps/mobile`.

Build configuration belongs in the repository-root `.env` or `.env.local`, not an
`apps/mobile/.env` file.

## Development

For simulator, emulator, or Android phone development, boot or connect a device, then install the
native client that matches this checkout before starting Metro:

```bash
vp run mobile:install ios [simulator-udid]
# Or: vp run mobile:install android [emulator-or-phone-serial]
vp run dev:client
```

The device argument can be omitted when exactly one device is booted or connected. The helper
compares this checkout's Expo fingerprint and the installed binary with its last install record,
and reuses a matching client. Otherwise it installs the build for that fingerprint from
`~/.cache/supaterm/native-clients/artifacts` and builds only when it is missing. One iOS simulator
build serves every iPhone and iPad simulator, and one APK per ABI (x86_64 or arm64-v8a) serves every
emulator and phone of that ABI. Build output goes to the log file it prints
(`SUPATERM_NATIVE_CLIENT_VERBOSE=1` streams it instead). Physical iPhones still use
`vp run ios:dev`.

For a read-only decision, run `node ../../scripts/mobile-native-client.ts check <ios|android>
[device]`: exit 0 means compatible, 2 means an install is needed, and 1 means an operational error.
An externally installed client is unverified until the helper installs it once.

Start Metro for an already verified dev client:

```bash
vp run dev:client
```

Metro keeps its transform cache between ordinary starts. If the cache itself is causing stale or
invalid output, clear it for one development-client start:

```bash
vp run dev:client:reset
```

Run that reset once after installing or changing the Uniwind dependency patch. Cached transforms
can otherwise reference its previous pnpm package path. Ordinary Metro starts still keep the cache.

Component edits use Fast Refresh. See [mobile development lifecycle](../../docs/internals/mobile-development.md)
before changing runtime ownership or refresh behavior.

Build and run the local iOS dev client:

```bash
vp run ios:dev
```

After changing a native dependency patch, rerun CocoaPods before rebuilding an existing iOS
project. pnpm gives each patch hash a new package path; Pods can otherwise keep compiling the
previous directory.

If your Xcode account only has a Personal Team, use a bundle identifier you control and opt into the
reduced-capability local build. Personal Team builds omit the widget and share extensions; builds
without this opt-in are unchanged.

```bash
SUPATERM_IOS_PERSONAL_TEAM=1 \
SUPATERM_IOS_PERSONAL_TEAM_BUNDLE_ID=com.example.supaterm.dev \
vp run ios:dev
```

Build and install a self-contained Release app that does not need Metro:

```bash
vp run ios:release
```

The Personal Team equivalent also needs a unique bundle identifier:

```bash
SUPATERM_IOS_PERSONAL_TEAM=1 \
SUPATERM_IOS_PERSONAL_TEAM_BUNDLE_ID=com.example.supaterm \
vp run ios:release
```

Build and run the local iOS preview app:

```bash
vp run ios:preview
```

Inspect the resolved Expo config for a variant:

```bash
vp run config:dev
vp run config:preview
```

Run static checks for mobile native code:

```bash
node ../../scripts/mobile-native-static-check.ts
```

The native lint task runs SwiftLint for Swift plus ktlint and detekt for Kotlin. Missing native tools are reported as warnings and skipped locally. CI installs the default toolset from `apps/mobile/Brewfile` before running the native checks.

## EAS Builds

Preview and production variants use Expo fingerprinting so OTA updates only reach binaries with matching native dependencies, config plugins, and patches. CI uses the `preview:dev` profile to reuse a compatible native build when possible.

The development variant uses `appVersion` to avoid recalculating the native fingerprint for each Metro launch manifest. `MOBILE_VERSION_POLICY` can override either default. If you distribute a custom Release build with the development identity and publish OTA updates to it, set `MOBILE_VERSION_POLICY=fingerprint` for both its build and updates. Changing the runtime policy requires a native rebuild for OTA matching; an existing dev client can still load local Metro bundles.

Set `SUPATERM_MOBILE_UPDATES_ENABLED=0` before prebuild and bundling a private binary to disable the
repository's configured Expo OTA update source.

Create a PR preview dev-client build manually:

```bash
vp run eas:ios:preview:dev
```

Create a cloud dev-client build:

```bash
vp run eas:ios:dev
```

Create a persistent preview build:

```bash
vp run eas:ios:preview
```

Android equivalents:

```bash
vp run eas:android:dev
vp run eas:android:preview:dev
vp run eas:android:preview
```
